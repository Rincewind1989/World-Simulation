This file gives a short Overview of the used equations in this simulation.

World Properties:

Update of the Food on a tile:
If the food is bigger than the maximum food a tile can have it decays by the following equation:

	food(t+1) = (MAX_FOOD_ON_TILE - food(t)) * FOOD_GROWTH_FACTOR

If not it grows with the chance of "CHANCE_FOOD_GROWTH" per frame by the following value:

	food(t+1) = Real_Distribution(0.0 , (MAX_FOOD_ON_TILE - food(t)) * FOOD_GROWTH_FACTOR) + food(t)

There is also a chance of "CHANCE_BIG_FOOD_GROWTH" to have a big growth in one frame by the following value:

	food(t+1) = Real_Distribution(MAX_FOOD_ON_TILE / 10.0, MAX_FOOD_ON_TILE / 5.0) + food(t)
